	<h3>Sebastian Marichal</h3>
	<h3>Robotics instructor</h3>
	<p>I’m a computer science researcher with special interest in Human Computer Interaction. Currently I’m a PhD student and my main interest is to determine how physical interaction supports cognition in different contexts and through diverse interaction paradigms such as tangibles, mixed-reality and wearbles devices.<br>

I’ve been also working with children for my Bachelor thesis where I’ve developed a mixed-reality interface for children with cerebral palsy.<br>

I also enjoy DIY and taking part into creative projects. I’m always searching new projects and challenges in order to continue my personal and professional developing.</p></div>
